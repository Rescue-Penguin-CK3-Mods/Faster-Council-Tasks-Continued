This is a continuation of the Faster Council Tasks Mod, which has not yet been updated to be compatible with recent updates to the game. If you are the original owner of the mod and wish to use my work to update your mod, please feel free to contact me.

This mod gives a boost to all counselor timed tasks:
- Almost all timed tasks will finish in 1 month, but it may change a bit depending on the task.
- Is important to say that this boost will only apply to human characters, not for AI Characters. So you and other players will be the only ones to have this boost.

Compatibility -
- Auto Convert Culture, Faith, and Control. Complete compatibility.
- More Game Rules - Download my compatibility patch (TODO: Add link)
- Councillor experience traits - TODO

If you have found a Bug or compatibility issue please comment below, or post as an issue on my github(https://github.com/Rescue-Penguin-CK3-Mods/Faster-Council-Tasks-Continued) and I will try my best to fix it.
