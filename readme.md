This mod gives a boost to all counselor timed tasks:
- Almost all timed tasks will finish in 1 month, but it may change a bit depending on the task.
- Is important to say that this boost will only apply to human characters, not for AI Characters. So you and other players will be the only ones to have this boost.

Any Bug you found please comment and I will try my best to fix it. Thank you for reading =D.
